It becomes hard to remove yourself from it and keeps you in a state of panic.\n\nNext time you find yourself struggling with racing thoughts, try this visualization technique to quiet your mind:\n\n- **Close your eyes** and let yourself visualize whatever comes to mind - not just words, but an actual image. Pay attention to all the details, explore it, allow yourself to wonder how it will change.\n- **Let your mind focus** on it completely. Allow the visualization to become more clear, more detailed, and more sharp. Sink deeper into the trance created by this visualization.\n- **Generate random items** from your racing thoughts and refocus them into something that helps you relax. For instance, visualize shooting those items into the air as if they shot from a cannon.\n- **Continue this visualization technique** and fall deeper and deeper into the trance. Eventually, you should become relaxed enough to fall asleep.\n\n_Reflecting on racing thoughts:_\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 How often does your mind keep you up at night and how do you handle it? \n_Task:_\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Write out your lights out time and your evening routine.\n_For Fun:_\n\ud83d\ude03 Post a gif that represents your brain at night in <#972604513255039047>\n", "Response Channel Id": "932056137518444594", "TextInput2_Label1": "Write out your lights out time and your evening routine.", "Button Channel Id": "932056137518444594", "TextInput1_Label1": "How often does your mind keep you up at night and how do you handle it?
