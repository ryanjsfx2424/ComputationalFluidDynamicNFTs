It keeps your mind racing and doesn\u2019t allow you to rest, physically or mentally.\n\n\ud83d\udcd6 If you find yourself frequently dealing with anxiety or stress in the evening, consider writing in a worry journal. A worry journal allows you to dump all your anxious feelings onto the pages.\u00a0\n\n\ud83e\udd14 It helps you express your feelings, and sometimes even discover solutions. The goal is to reduce your anxieties and hush those racing thoughts.\n\n\ud83d\uddd2\ufe0f This works for those random to-do lists you have floating around or even things you\u2019re excited about. Flesh out, in your journal, what you\u2019re feeling and why. Your brain will get a sense of completion for the fact that you\u2019ve just written this down and it\u2019ll give you an incredible amount of peace.\n\n\ud83d\udc4b After getting those anxieties off your chest, leave those worries in the journal. Those worries shouldn\u2019t cross the threshold into your sleep sanctuary.\u00a0\n\nWhatever is worrying you can wait until tomorrow. For now, you can\u2019t handle it very efficiently without a well-rested brain.\n\n_Journaling reflection:_\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 What thoughts keep you up at night?\n\n_Task:_\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Write out your lights out time and your evening routine.\n\n_For Fun:_\n\ud83d\ude03 Post a gif that represents your brain at night in <#972604513255039047>.\n\n{\ud83e\udd2b Secret code...

Feeling guilty about it causes us to feel like failures which tends to lead to failing again rather than push us in the direction we want to move.\u00a0\nOne way to avoid feeling guilty about giving into temptation (which we all do) is to condition it on the success of a mini-goal. For example, promise yourself that you\u2019ll only eat that donut or cookie you\u2019re craving if you follow through on your lunch plan. That way, you avoid feeling bad about it and it doesn't snowball into repeated \u2018failure.\u2019>>>\n\n<<<How to play:::\n\ud83c\udf89 **How to Play **\ud83c\udf89\n\n_Win prizes while building your own habits!_\n\nEach week day, new prompts are posted that is centered around nutrition.

It becomes hard to remove yourself from it and keeps you in a state of panic.\n\nNext time you find yourself struggling with racing thoughts, try this visualization technique to quiet your mind:\n\n- **Close your eyes** and let yourself visualize whatever comes to mind - not just words, but an actual image. Pay attention to all the details, explore it, allow yourself to wonder how it will change.\n- **Let your mind focus** on it completely. Allow the visualization to become more clear, more detailed, and more sharp. Sink deeper into the trance created by this visualization.\n- **Generate random items** from your racing thoughts and refocus them into something that helps you relax. For instance, visualize shooting those items into the air as if they shot from a cannon.\n- **Continue this visualization technique** and fall deeper and deeper into the trance. Eventually, you should become relaxed enough to fall asleep.\n\n_Reflecting on racing thoughts:_\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 How often does your mind keep you up at night and how do you handle it? \n_Task:_\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Write out your lights out time and your evening routine.\n_For Fun:_\n\ud83d\ude03 Post a gif that represents your brain at night in <#972604513255039047>\n", "TextInput2_Label1": "Write out your lights out time and your evening routine.", "TextInput1_Label1": "How often does your mind keep you up at night and how do you handle it?

We are not sending you on a weird diet.
